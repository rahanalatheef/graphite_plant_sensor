### Project Description
[A cutting-edge sensor that detects when your houseplants are craving more graphite. Because photosynthesis clearly isn‚Äôt enough.]



### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Plants are out here living their best green lives... but what if they‚Äôre secretly yearning for graphite? Pencils sit ignored while your ficus weeps in artistic silence.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We created a sensor that measures your plant‚Äôs graphite deficiency levels using totally made-up science. When your fern hits critical graphite hunger, it triggers a tiny pencil-sharpener alarm. Bonus: it tweets your plant‚Äôs status using plant-themed poetry.]

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:For Software:

[Languages used: HTML (for serious structure), CSS (for leafy aesthetics), JavaScript (to animate sad plant eyes when graphite is low)][

[Frameworks used: React (because your plant deserves a dynamic UI)]

[Libraries used: Chart.js (to graph the graphite levels over time... obviously), Poetry.js (to auto-generate sad haikus from your plant)]

[Tools used: Git (to version control plant moods), Netlify (to deploy the leafy cry for help)]




### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
[git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graphite-plant-sensor  
cd graphite-plant-sensor  
npm install]

# Run
[npm start  
# Then open http://localhost:3000 and listen for your plants crying in graphite-deficiency].

## Team Contributions
Leaf Engineer (Name 1):
Designed the Graphite Detection Algorithm‚Ñ¢ and trained the sensor to recognize the emotional spectrum of plant sadness. Also responsible for naming the cactus ‚ÄúGraphito.‚Äù

Front-End Botanist (Name 2):
Built the React-based dashboard where plant data blooms in real time. Styled the sad plant animations and programmed the emergency ‚Äúpencil now‚Äù pop-up alert.

Back-End Sap Master (Name 3):
Set up the Node.js server, connected Twitter API for poetic graphite alerts, and ensured that data from the Arduino flows like photosynthesis.
